# ADB MCP Server
[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/@srmorete/adb-mcp)](https://smithery.ai/server/@srmorete/adb-mcp)

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for interacting with Android devices through ADB. This TypeScript-based tool provides a bridge between AI models and Android device functionality.

## Features

- üì± Device Management - List and interact with connected Android devices
- üì¶ App Installation - Deploy APK files to connected devices
- üìã Logging - Access device logs through logcat
- üîÑ File Transfer - Push and pull files between device and host
- üì∏ UI Interaction - Capture screenshots and analyze UI hierarchy
- üîß Shell Command Execution - Run custom commands on the device

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher recommended, tested with Node.js v16, v18, and v20)
- ADB (Android Debug Bridge) installed and in your PATH
- An Android device or emulator connected via USB or network with USB debugging enabled
- Permission to access the device (accepted debugging authorization on device)

## Installation

### Installing via Smithery

To install ADB Android Device Server for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@srmorete/adb-mcp):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @srmorete/adb-mcp --client claude
```

### Manual Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/srmorete/adb-mcp.git
cd adb-mcp

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the TypeScript code
npm run build

# Run the server
npx adb-mcp
```

## Configuration

### ADB Path Configuration

The server uses default ADB paths. For custom ADB location:

```bash
export ADB_PATH=/path/to/adb
npx adb-mcp
```

### MCP Configuration

Add the ADB MCP server configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "adb": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": [
           "adb-mcp"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## Usage

### Starting the Server

**IMPORTANT: The server must be running before using any ADB tools.**

Start the server using:

```bash
npx adb-mcp
```

You should see:
```
[INFO] ADB MCP Server connected and ready
```

Keep this terminal window open while using the ADB tools.

### Available Tools

All tools are available with the following naming convention:

#### üì± Device Management

- `adb_devices` - List connected devices
- `adb_shell` - Execute shell commands on a device

#### üì¶ App Management

- `adb_install` - Install an APK file using a local file path

#### üìã Logging

- `adb_logcat` - View device logs with optional filtering

#### üîÑ File Transfer

- `adb_pull` - Pull files from a device
- `adb_push` - Push files to a device

#### üîç UI Interaction

- `dump_image` - Take a screenshot of the current screen
- `inspect_ui` - Get UI hierarchy in XML format (most useful for AI interaction)

## Troubleshooting

If tools aren't working:

- **Server Issues:**
  - Ensure the server is running (`npx adb-mcp`)
  - Check server output for error messages
  - Try detailed logs: `LOG_LEVEL=3 npx adb-mcp`
  - Kill hanging processes:
    - `ps aux | grep "adb-mcp" | grep -v grep`
    - then `kill -9 [PID]`

- **Device Connection:**
  - Verify connection with `adb_devices`
  - If "unauthorized", accept debugging authorization on device
  - Check USB/network connections
  - Try restarting ADB: `adb kill-server && adb start-server`

- **ADB Issues:**
  - Verify ADB installation: `adb version`

- **Device Setup:**
  - Use an emulator (it was built using one), for real devices maybe try this:
    - Ensure USB debugging is enabled
    - For newer Android versions, enable "USB debugging (Security settings)"
    - Try different USB port or cable
    - or let me know in an issue

## Compatibility

- Android 8.0 and higher
- MCP clients including Claude in Cursor IDE
- Was built on macOS but **should** run on any POSIX compatible (Linux etc).
- Did not try on Windows but **maybe** it works.

## Contributing

- Contributions are welcome! Submit a Pull Request.
- For major changes, open an issue to discuss first.
- You can, of course, also fork it
- **Note:** this project was `vibe-coded` so if you spot some weird stuff... well now you know üôÇ
