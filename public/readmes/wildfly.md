# WildFly MCP

This project aims to define tooling allowing WildFly users to benefenit from the Generative AI capabilities when monitoring and managing WildFly servers.

* [WildFly MCP Server](wildfly-mcp-server/README.md): A WildFly [MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) to integrate with your AI chatbot in order to interact with WildFly server using natural language.

* [WildFly Chat Bot](wildfly-chat-bot/README.md): A WildFly Chat Bot to interact with WildFly servers. This AI chatbot allows to also integrate MCP servers (STDIO and SSE protocol).

* [Container Images](container-images/README.md): Container images for mcp server and the chat bot (that contains both the chat bot and the mcp server. Ready to interact with your WildFly servers on the cloud). Example of OpenShift deployment is provided.

* [MCP STDIO to SEE protocol gateway](mcp-stdio-sse-gateway/README.md): A Java gateway allowing to integrate SSE MCP servers in chat applications that only support STDIO protocol.

* [Wait MCP Server](wait-mcp-server/README.md): A simple [MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) that allows LLM to wait for some seconds. Can be useful in some workflow.
