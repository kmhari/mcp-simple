## Overview

React MCP provides a bridge between Claude AI and the React ecosystem, allowing Claude to:

- Create new React applications
- Run React development servers
- Manage files and directories
- Install npm packages
- Execute terminal commands
- Track and manage long-running processes

This server implements the Model Context Protocol, providing Claude with the ability to perform real-world actions in the development environment.

## Features

- **React Project Management**

  - Create new React applications with optional templates
  - Run development servers
  - Manage dependencies

- **File Operations**

  - Read and write files
  - Edit React components and configuration

- **Process Management**

  - Start and monitor long-running processes
  - Track process output in real-time
  - Terminate processes when needed

- **Command Execution**

  - Run arbitrary terminal commands
  - Install npm packages
  - Execute development tasks

- **Comprehensive Logging**
  - Detailed JSON and text logs
  - Process tracking with timestamps
  - Execution history

## Installation

### Installing via Smithery

To install React MCP for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@Streen9/react-mcp):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @Streen9/react-mcp --client claude
```

### Manual Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

Add this in `claude_desktop_config`:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "react-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "C:/Users/kalip/OneDrive/Desktop/react-mcp/index.js"
      ]
    },
  }
}
```

The server runs on the stdio transport, allowing it to be used with Desktop Claude APP as a Model Context Protocol tool.
