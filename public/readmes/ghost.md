# Ghost MCP Server

## ‼️ Important Notice: Python to TypeScript Migration
I've completely rewritten the Ghost MCP Server from Python to TypeScript in this v0.1.0 release. This major change brings several benefits:

- Simplified installation: Now available as an NPM package (@fanyangmeng/ghost-mcp)
- Improved reliability: Uses the official @tryghost/admin-api client instead of custom implementation
- Better maintainability: TypeScript provides type safety and better code organization
- Streamlined configuration: Simple environment variable setup

### Breaking Changes

- Python dependencies are no longer required
- Configuration method has changed (now using Node.js environment variables)
- Docker deployment has been simplified
- Different installation process (now using NPM)

Please see the below updated documentation for details on migrating from the Python version. If you encounter any issues, feel free to open an issue on GitHub.

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for interacting with Ghost CMS through LLM interfaces like Claude. This server provides secure and comprehensive access to your Ghost blog, leveraging JWT authentication and a rich set of MCP tools for managing posts, users, members, tiers, offers, and newsletters.
