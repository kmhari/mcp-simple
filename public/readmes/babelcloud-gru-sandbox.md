# gbox

**gbox** is a self-hostable sandbox for AI Agents to execute commands, surf web and use desktop/mobile. See "Features" section for details.

This project is based on the technology behind [gru.ai](https://gru.ai). It has been tested over 100000 Agent jobs.

As MCP is getting more and more popular, we also implemented a MCP server to make it easy to be directly integrated into MCP client such as Claude Desktop/Cursor.

### Command Line Usage (Under Development)

The project provides a command-line tool `gbox` for managing sandbox containers:

```bash
# Login to gbox.cloud
gbox login

# Profile management
gbox profile add --key <key> --name <name>                  # add profile
gbox profile list                                           # list all profiles
gbox profile use [index]                                    # switch current profile (interactive if index omitted)
gbox profile delete <index>                                 # delete profile
gbox profile current                                        # show current profile

# Local environment
gbox setup                                                  # initialize local runtime environment (alias: cluster setup)
gbox cleanup                                                # clean up local runtime environment (alias: cluster cleanup)

# Container (Box) management
gbox box create --image python:3.9 --env DEBUG=true -- python -c "print('hello')"  # create a box
gbox box list                                               # list boxes
gbox box terminate <box-id>                                 # terminate box
gbox box exec <box-id> -- ls /                              # execute command inside box
gbox box cp <box-id>:<container-path> <local-path>          # file copy
gbox box inspect <box-id>                                   # inspect box

# Android CUA (requires OPENAI_API_KEY)
gbox cua android "Open Uber and order a ride to CUHK"

# MCP configuration
gbox mcp export                                             # export config only
gbox mcp export --merge-to claude                           # merge into Claude Desktop
gbox mcp export --merge-to cursor                           # merge into Cursor
gbox mcp export --dry-run                                   # preview merge result
```

## Computer-Using Agent on Android

### 📋 Prerequisites

1. An Android device connected via USB or ADB over TCP/IP
2. ADB (Android Debug Bridge) installed and configured
3. API key for OpenAI with access to the computer-use-preview model

### 🔧 Setting up ADB

ADB (Android Debug Bridge) is required for gbox to communicate with your Android device:

1. **Install ADB**:
   - **Windows**: Download [Android SDK Platform Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools) and extract the ZIP file
   - **macOS**: `brew install android-platform-tools`
   - **Linux**: `sudo apt install adb` (Ubuntu/Debian) or `sudo pacman -S android-tools` (Arch)

2. **Add ADB to your PATH**:
   - **Windows**: Add the path to the extracted platform-tools folder to your system's PATH environment variable
   - **macOS/Linux**: Add the following to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc:
     ```bash
     export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/platform-tools
     ```

3. **Verify ADB installation**:
   ```bash
   adb version
   ```

4. **Enable USB debugging on your Android device**:
   - Go to **Settings → About phone**
   - Tap **Build number** 7 times to enable Developer options
   - Go to **Settings → System → Developer options** (location may vary by device)
   - Enable **USB debugging**

5. **Connect Android device via USB and confirm ADB connected**
   ```bash
   adb devices -l
   List of devices attached
   897X0691U       Pixel_3 device
   ```
6. **Set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable and enjoy gbox Android CUA**
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
   gbox cua android "Open Uber and book a ride to The Chinese University of Hong Kong now."
   ```
   
   The video demonstration for this task can be found in the first use case below under "Use Cases" section.


### Use Cases
#### 1. Call an Uber

**Prompt**: Open Uber and book a ride to The Chinese University of Hong Kong now.

### Things to Know about Dev and Debug Locally

#### How to run gbox in dev env instead of the system installed one

1. Stop the installed gbox by `gbox cleanup`. It will stop the api server so that you can run the api server in dev env.
2. Execute `make api-dev` in project root.
3. Execute `./gbox box list`, this is the command run from your dev env.

#### How to connect MCP client such as Claude Desktop to the MCP server in dev env

1. Execute `make mcp-dev` in project root.
2. Execute `./gbox mcp export --merge-to claude`

#### How to open MCP inspect

1. Execute `make mcp-inspect` in project root.
2. Click the link returned in terminal.

#### How to build and use image in dev env

1. Execute `make build-image-python` in project root to build Python image, or `make build-images` to build all images.
2. Change the image name as needed (e.g., `make build-image-typescript` for TypeScript image).
3. You may need to delete current sandboxes to make the new image effective `./gbox box delete --all`

#### Why MCP client still get the old MCP content?

1. After you change MCP configuration such as tool definitions, you need to run `make build` to update the `dist/index.js` file.
2. You may also need to execute `./gbox mcp export --merge-to claude`
