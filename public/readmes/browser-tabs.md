## Available Tools

- `get_tabs`: Retrieves all open tabs from Google Chrome browser, returning their titles and URLs. Tabs are grouped by window and displayed in a format like "Window 1-1" (Window 1, Tab 1).

- `close_tab`: Closes a specific tab in Google Chrome using window and tab indices.
  - Parameters:
    - windowIndex: Window number (starts from 1)
    - tabIndex: Tab number within the window (starts from 1)
  - Note: When closing multiple tabs, start from the highest index numbers to avoid index shifting. After closing tabs, use get_tabs to confirm the changes.
