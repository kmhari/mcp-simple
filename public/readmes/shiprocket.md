# 🚀 Shiprocket MCP Integration

This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Shiprocket.

With this, you can:
- Check best and fastest serviceable courier partners(based on city or pincodes) and their shipping rates
- Create, update (single or bulk), and cancel orders
- Ship orders directly
- Track orders using the AWB number, Shiprocket Order ID, or Source Order ID

It connects to your personal Shiprocket account directly via Email and password.

### Here's an example of what you can do when it's connected to Claude.

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
- Node (version > 20.0.0 and < 23.0.0)
- Claude Desktop app (or Cursor)

## 🛠️ Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bfrs/shiprocket-mcp.git
cd shiprocket-mcp
```

### 2. Install Dependencies using the existing package.json
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the binary
npm run build
```

### 3. Connect to MCP server
Add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json` or `mcp.json`

```bash
{
 "mcpServers": {
   "Shiprocket": {
     "command": "npm",
      "args": [
        "--prefix",
        "{{PATH_TO_SRC}}",
        "start",
        "--silent"
      ],
      "env": {
       "SELLER_EMAIL":"<Your Shiprocket Email>",
       "SELLER_PASSWORD":"<Your Shiprocket password>"
     }
   }
 }
}
```

For Claude, save this as claude_desktop_config.json in your Claude Desktop configuration directory at:
```bash
~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```
For Cursor, save this as mcp.json in your Cursor configuration directory at:
```bash
~/.cursor/mcp.json
```

Open Claude Desktop and you should now see ``Shiprocket`` as an available integration.

Or restart Cursor.

## MCP Tools
Clients (Claude or Cursor) can access the following tools to interact with Shiprocket:

- `estimated_date_of_delivery` - To know more about the date of delivery for any location.
- `shipping_rate_calculator` - To check shippable couriers with their rates and coverage.
- `list_pickup_addresses` - List all the configured pickup addresses.
