## System Prompt Recommendations

This section outlines recommended guidelines for system prompts or rules for LLMs to ensure optimal interaction and task execution.

```Markdown
## Decision Making
- **Ambiguous tasks**: ALWAYS clarify using `ask_user` tool via MCP
- **Requires decisions**: ALWAYS clarify using `ask_user` tool via MCP

## Code Development
- **Final confirmation**: MUST ask user if all requirements from specification are completed using `ask_user` tool via MCP with work report
```

## System Prompt Recommendations for ***Cursor IDE***

```Markdown
## Decision Making
- **Ambiguous tasks**: ALWAYS clarify using `mcp_mcp-interactive_ask_user` tool via MCP
- **Requires decisions**: ALWAYS clarify using `mcp_mcp-interactive_ask_user` tool via MCP

## Code Development
- **Final confirmation**: MUST ask user if all requirements from specification are completed using `mcp_mcp-interactive_ask_user` tool via MCP with work report

## Command Line Options

- `--timeout` or `-t` (seconds): Specifies the waiting time for the user's response dialog. If no response is received within this period, the reply "User did not reply: Timeout occurred." will be sent.


## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Electron not starting:**
- Ensure the current version of Node.js is installed
- Try reinstalling dependencies by running: `npm install`

**Timeout issues for answer (progressbar):**
- Increase timeout value using `-t` parameter
- Default timeout is 60 seconds, adjust as needed
