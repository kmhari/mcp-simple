## Configuration for Claude for Desktop

This MCP server works with other MCP-enabled clients, but let's start with Claude.
It uses the `STDIO` transport to interact with the server.
See the next section for the instructions on configuring the server with `StreamableHTTP` transport.

### Prerequisites

1. Download and install Claude for Desktop application from [Claude](https://claude.ai/download).
   This MCP server works with other MCP-enabled clients, but let's start with Claude.

1. Make sure you have Docker or Podman installed and ready to use on your desktop/laptop.

1. Get your AIStor (or MinIO) object store credentials (`MINIO_ACCESS_KEY` and `MINIO_SECRET_KEY`) and its endpoint location.
   If you don't have an AIStor or MinIO server available, feel free to use the values for [MinIO Playground server](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/administration/minio-console.html#logging-in).

### Configuration file

Open the Claude for Desktop configuration file with your favorite text editor.
To find the config file in your system follow the [Quickstart instructions](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user) from the Model Context Protocol site.
Its default location is:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

Add the following lines to the config file, replacing the credentials, endpoint, and `YOUR_USERNAME` with their actual values.
This example uses Podman, but if you use Docker replace `podman` in the `command:` field with `docker`.
If you have other MCP servers configured just insert the AIStor config in the list.

Be careful when adding the `--allow-*` flags. By default without any flags the server will be running in read-only mode.
Add `--allow-write` and `--allow-delete` flags to this configuration only when you need them.
The `--allow-admin` flag enables admin functions that collect information about the cluster.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aistor": {
      "command": "podman",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-v",
        "/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Downloads:/Downloads",
        "-e",
        "MINIO_ENDPOINT=REPLACE_WITH_ENDPOINT",
        "-e",
        "MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=REPLACE_WITH_ACCESS_KEY",
        "-e",
        "MINIO_SECRET_KEY=REPLACE_WITH_SECRET_KEY",
        "-e",
        "MINIO_USE_SSL=true",
        "quay.io/minio/aistor/mcp-server-aistor:latest",
        "--allowed-directories",
        "/Downloads",
        "--allow-write",
        "--allow-delete",
        "--allow-admin"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

By default, the number of objects or buckets that the server lists and send to LLM is limited by 1000 objects.
This is done to avoid hitting the limit of the model's context window in tokens.
If your model allows wider context window you can increase this number by adding the `--max-keys` parameter to the configuration file.
Keep in mind that each object record contains several dozen of tokens.

## Configuration for StreamableHTTP

This MCP server works with other MCP-enabled clients, that support the `StreamableHTTP` transport.

### Prerequisites

1. Download and install an LLM client that supports MCP and StreamableHTTP.
   For example, you can use [Cherry Studio](https://www.cherry-ai.com/download).

1. Make sure you have Docker or Podman installed and ready to use on your desktop/laptop.

1. Get your AIStor (or MinIO) object store credentials (`MINIO_ACCESS_KEY` and `MINIO_SECRET_KEY`) and its endpoint location.
   If you don't have an AIStor or MinIO server available, feel free to use the values for [MinIO Playground server](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/administration/minio-console.html#logging-in).

### Run the server

Run the following command to start the server.
Replace the values for `MINIO_ENDPOINT`, `MINIO_ACCESS_KEY`, and `MINIO_SECRET_KEY` with your actual values.
Replace `8090` (in three places!)with the port number available on your system.

```bash
podman run -d --name aistor-mcp-server \
  -v /Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Downloads:/Downloads \
  -e MINIO_ENDPOINT=REPLACE_WITH_ENDPOINT \
  -e MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=REPLACE_WITH_ACCESS_KEY \
  -e MINIO_SECRET_KEY=REPLACE_WITH_SECRET_KEY \
  -e MINIO_USE_SSL=true \
  -p 8090:8090 \
  quay.io/minio/aistor/mcp-server-aistor:latest \
  --allowed-directories /Downloads \
  --allow-admin \
  --allow-delete \
  --allow-write \
  --http \
  --http-port 8090
```

### Configure the client

In the client, add the following configuration:

- MCP server name: `aistor`
- Type: `StreamableHTTP`
- URL: `http://localhost:8090/mcp`

### Test the connection

Check if you can list the tools available in the server. Use the "Tools" tab in the client.

### Stop the server

```bash
podman stop aistor-mcp-server
```

## Usage

Here are some examples of what you can do:

### Basic Operations

- "List all buckets on my AIStor server"
- "List the contents of bucket test"

### File Operations

- "Download the file example.pdf to my Downloads directory"
- "Create a bucket my-bucket"
- "Upload document.pdf from Downloads to bucket my-bucket"

### Metadata Operations

- "Get metadata of file.pdf in bucket my-bucket"
- "List all tags for object config.json"

### Admin Operations

- "Show server health status"
- "Get storage usage statistics"

Each command will return human-readable responses with relevant information.

## Available tools

Usually the Large Language Model (LLM) will be able to figure out which tool to use for your request.
Sometimes, you may want to tell the model explicitly which tool to use.
For such cases and also to let you know what else is possible with this MCP server, here is the list of tools available in this version.

You can always get this list by clicking the hammer icon in your Claude for Desktop application.
