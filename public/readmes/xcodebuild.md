## Overview

This project implements an MCP server that exposes Xcode operations as tools that can be invoked by AI agents via the MCP protocol. It enables programmatic interaction with Xcode projects through a standardised interface, optimised for agent-driven development workflows.

<caption>Using Cursor to build, install, and launch an app on the iOS simulator while capturing logs at run-time.</caption>

## Why?

The XcodeBuild MCP tool exists primarily to streamline and standardise interaction between AI agents and Xcode projects. By providing dedicated tools for common Xcode operations, it removes reliance on manual or potentially incorrect command-line invocations.

This ensures a reliable and efficient development process, allowing agents to seamlessly leverage Xcode's capabilities while reducing the risk of configuration errors.

Critically, this MCP enables AI agents to independently validate code changes by building projects, inspecting errors, and iterating autonomously. In contrast to user-driven tools like Sweetpad, XcodeBuild MCP empowers agents to automate these workflows effectively.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- macOS 14.5 or later
- Xcode 16.x or later
- Node 18.x or later

### Configure your MCP client

#### Quick install

For a quick install, you can use the following links:

- [![Install MCP Server](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg)](https://cursor.com/install-mcp?name=XcodeBuildMCP&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoibnB4IC15IHhjb2RlYnVpbGRtY3BAbGF0ZXN0In0%3D)
- [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-VS_Code?style=flat-square&label=Install%20Server&color=0098FF" alt="Install in VS Code">](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=XcodeBuildMCP&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22xcodebuildmcp%40latest%22%5D%7D)
- [<img alt="Install in VS Code Insiders" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-VS_Code_Insiders?style=flat-square&label=Install%20Server&color=24bfa5">](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=XcodeBuildMCP&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22xcodebuildmcp%40latest%22%5D%7D&quality=insiders)

#### Manual installation

Configure your MCP client (Windsurf, Cursor, Claude Desktop, Claude Code etc.) to use the XcodeBuildMCP server by ammending your client application's MCP configuration.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "XcodeBuildMCP": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "xcodebuildmcp@latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Alternative installation method using mise

Alternatively, you can use XcodeBuildMCP without a specific installation of Node.js by using `mise` to install it:

```bash
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install mise

# Other installation methods
# See https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html
```

Then configure your MCP client to use mise to install XcodeBuildMCP:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "XcodeBuildMCP": {
      "command": "mise",
      "args": [
        "x",
        "npm:xcodebuildmcp@1.10.4",
        "--",
        "xcodebuildmcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> When using mise avoid using the @latest tag as mise will cache the package and may not update to the latest version automatically, instead prefer an explicit version number.

#### Installing via Smithery

To install XcodeBuildMCP Server for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@cameroncooke/XcodeBuildMCP):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @cameroncooke/XcodeBuildMCP --client claude
```

## Incremental build support

XcodeBuildMCP includes experimental support for incremental builds. This feature is disabled by default and can be enabled by setting the `INCREMENTAL_BUILDS_ENABLED` environment variable to `true`:

To enable incremental builds, set the `INCREMENTAL_BUILDS_ENABLED` environment variable to `true`:

Example MCP client configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "XcodeBuildMCP": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "xcodebuildmcp@latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "INCREMENTAL_BUILDS_ENABLED": "true"
      }        
    }
  }
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note that incremental builds support is currently highly experimental and your mileage may vary. Please report any issues you encounter to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/cameroncooke/XcodeBuildMCP/issues).

## Code Signing for Device Deployment

For device deployment features to work, code signing must be properly configured in Xcode **before** using XcodeBuildMCP device tools:

1. Open your project in Xcode
2. Select your project target
3. Go to "Signing & Capabilities" tab
4. Configure "Automatically manage signing" and select your development team
5. Ensure a valid provisioning profile is selected

> **Note**: XcodeBuildMCP cannot configure code signing automatically. This initial setup must be done once in Xcode, after which the MCP device tools can build, install, and test apps on physical devices.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with XcodeBuildMCP, the diagnostic tool can help identify the problem by providing detailed information about your environment and dependencies.

### Diagnostic Tool

The diagnostic tool is a standalone utility that checks your system configuration and reports on the status of all dependencies required by XcodeBuildMCP. It's particularly useful when reporting issues.

```bash
# Run the diagnostic tool using npx
npx --package xcodebuildmcp@latest xcodebuildmcp-diagnostic
```

The diagnostic tool will output comprehensive information about:

- System and Node.js environment
- Xcode installation and configuration
- Required dependencies (xcodebuild, AXe, etc.)
- Environment variables affecting XcodeBuildMCP
- Feature availability status

When reporting issues on GitHub, please include the full output from the diagnostic tool to help with troubleshooting.

### MCP Server Logs

It can be helpful to have access to the log messages from the MCP server to identify any issues. The logs are captured by the client application, for example in Cursor:

Cursor:
```bash
find ~/Library/Application\ Support/Cursor/logs -name "Cursor MCP.log" -exec zip -r matching_logs.zip {} +
```

If your MCP client doesn't have log files you can run the server directly using the MCP Inspector tool see [Debugging](CONTRIBUTING.md#debugging) for more information on how to do this. Once running the MCP tool prints all log messages to it's error pane, which can be helpful in diagnosing issues.

## Privacy

This project uses [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) for error monitoring and diagnostics. Sentry helps us track issues, crashes, and unexpected errors to improve the reliability and stability of XcodeBuildMCP.

### What is sent to Sentry?
- Only error-level logs and diagnostic information are sent to Sentry by default.
- Error logs may include details such as error messages, stack traces, and (in some cases) file paths or project names. You can review the sources in this repository to see exactly what is logged.

### Opting Out of Sentry
- If you do not wish to send error logs to Sentry, you can opt out by setting the environment variable `SENTRY_DISABLED=true`.

Example MCP client configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "XcodeBuildMCP": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "xcodebuildmcp@latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "SENTRY_DISABLED": "true"
      }        
    }
  }
}
```

## Selective tool registration

By default all tools are enabled but for some clients it may be useful to only enable specific tools to reduce the amount of context that is sent to the client. This can be achieved by setting specific environment variables in your clients MCP configuration.

Once you have enabled one or more tools or groups of tools all other tools will be disabled. For example, to enable only the simulator related tools, you can set the environment variable to `XCODEBUILDMCP_GROUP_IOS_SIMULATOR_WORKFLOW=true` this will only expose tools for building, running and debugging on simulators

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "XcodeBuildMCP": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "xcodebuildmcp@latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "XCODEBUILDMCP_GROUP_IOS_SIMULATOR_WORKFLOW": "true"
      }        
    }
  }
}
```

You can find a list of available tools and detailed instructions on how to enable them in the [TOOL_OPTIONS.md](TOOL_OPTIONS.md) file.
