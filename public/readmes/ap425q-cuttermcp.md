## MCP Clients

Theoretically, any MCP client should work with cutterMCP. one example is given below.

## Example 1: Claude Desktop
To set up Claude Desktop as a Cutter MCP client, go to `Claude` -> `Settings` -> `Developer` -> `Edit Config` -> `claude_desktop_config.json` and add the following:

MacOS/Linux :
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cutter": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": [
        "/ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO/bridge_mcp_cutter.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Windows :
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cutter": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": [
        "C:\\ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO\\bridge_mcp_cutter.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
