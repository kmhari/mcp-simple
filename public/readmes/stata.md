## Extension Settings

You can customize the extension behavior through VS Code settings:

- `stata-vscode.stataPath`: Path to Stata installation directory
- `stata-vscode.mcpServerHost`: Host for MCP server (default: localhost)
- `stata-vscode.mcpServerPort`: Port for the MCP server (default: 4000)
- `stata-vscode.autoStartServer`: Automatically start MCP server when extension activates (default: true)
- `stata-vscode.debugMode`: Show detailed debug information in output panel (default: false)
- `stata-vscode.forcePort`: Force the MCP server to use the specified port even if it's already in use (default: false)
- `stata-vscode.clineConfigPath`: Custom path to Cline configuration file (optional, defaults to standard locations)
- `stata-vscode.runFileTimeout`: Timeout in seconds for 'Run File' operations (default: 600 seconds / 10 minutes)
- `stata-vscode.stataEdition`: Stata edition to use (MP, SE, BE) - default: MP
- `stata-vscode.logFileLocation`: Location for Stata log files - 'extension' (logs folder in extension directory), 'workspace' (same directory as .do file), or 'custom' (user-specified directory) - default: extension
- `stata-vscode.customLogDirectory`: Custom directory for Stata log files (only used when logFileLocation is set to 'custom')

## Usage

1. Open a Stata .do file
2. Run commands using:
   - **Run Selection**: Select Stata code and press `Ctrl+Shift+Enter` (or `Cmd+Shift+Enter` on Mac)
   - **Run File**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+D` (or `Cmd+Shift+D` on Mac) to run the entire .do file
3. View output in the editor panel
4. **Choose Stata Edition**: Select your preferred Stata edition (MP, SE, or BE) in the extension settings

## Log File Management

The extension automatically creates log files when running Stata .do files. You can control where these log files are saved:

1. **Extension Directory** (default): Log files are saved in a `logs` folder within the extension directory, keeping your workspace clean
2. **Workspace Directory**: Log files are saved in the same directory as your .do file (original behavior)
3. **Custom Directory**: Log files are saved to a directory you specify

To change this setting:
1. Open VS Code/Cursor settings
2. Search for "Stata MCP"
3. Find "Log File Location" and select your preferred option
4. If using "Custom Directory", also set the "Custom Log Directory" path

## How It Works

The extension creates a local MCP server that connects your editor to Stata, enabling:

1. **Command Execution**: Run Stata commands and see results instantly
2. **Context Awareness**: AI assistants understand your Stata data and commands
3. **Enhanced Productivity**: Get intelligent code suggestions and documentation


## Cursor MCP Configuration

The extension automatically configures Cursor MCP integration. To verify it's working:

1. Open Cursor
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) to open the Command Palette
3. Type "Stata: Test MCP Server Connection" and press Enter
4. You should see a success message if the server is properly connected

### Cursor Configuration File Paths

The location of Cursor MCP configuration files varies by operating system:

- **macOS**:
  - Primary location: `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
  - Alternative location: `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/mcp.json`

- **Windows**:
  - Primary location: `%USERPROFILE%\.cursor\mcp.json`
  - Alternative location: `%APPDATA%\Cursor\User\mcp.json`

- **Linux**:
  - Primary location: `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
  - Alternative location: `~/.config/Cursor/User/mcp.json`

### Manual Cursor Configuration

If you need to manually configure Cursor MCP:

1. Create or edit the MCP configuration file:
   - **macOS/Linux**: `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
   - **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\.cursor\mcp.json`

2. Add the Stata MCP server configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "stata-mcp": {
         "url": "http://localhost:4000/mcp",
         "transport": "sse"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. If the file already contains other MCP servers, just add the `"stata-mcp"` entry to the existing `"mcpServers"` object.

4. Save the file and restart Cursor.

### Troubleshooting Cursor Configuration

If Cursor is not recognizing the Stata MCP server:
1. Verify the MCP server is running
2. Check that the configuration file exists with the correct content
3. Try restarting Cursor
4. Ensure there are no port conflicts with other running applications

## Cline MCP Configuration


1. Open your Cline MCP settings file:
   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`
   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`
   - **Linux**: `~/.config/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`

2. Add the Stata MCP server configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "stata-mcp": {
         "url": "http://localhost:4000/mcp",
         "transport": "sse"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. If the file already contains other MCP servers, just add the `"stata-mcp"` entry to the existing `"mcpServers"` object.

4. Save the file and restart VS Code.

You can also configure Cline through VS Code settings:
```json
"cline.mcpSettings": {
  "stata-mcp": {
    "url": "http://localhost:4000/mcp",
    "transport": "sse"
  }
}
```

### Troubleshooting Cline Configuration

If Cline is not recognizing the Stata MCP server:
1. Verify the MCP server is running (Status bar should show "Stata")
2. Check that the configuration file exists with the correct content
3. Try restarting VS Code
4. Check the extension output panel (View > Output > Stata MCP) for any errors

## Claude Desktop MCP Configuration

You can use this extension with Claude Desktop through mcp-proxy:

1. Make sure the Stata MCP extension is installed in VS Code or Cursor and currently running before attempting to configure Claude Desktop
2. Install mcp-proxy:
   ```bash
   # Using pip
   pip install mcp-proxy
   
   # Or using uv (faster)
   uv install mcp-proxy
   ```

3. Find the path to mcp-proxy:
   ```bash
   # On Mac/Linux
   which mcp-proxy
   
   # On Windows (PowerShell)
   (Get-Command mcp-proxy).Path
   ```

4. Configure Claude Desktop by editing the MCP config file:

   **On Windows** (typically at `%APPDATA%\Claude Desktop\claude_desktop_config.json`):
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "stata-mcp": {
         "command": "mcp-proxy",
         "args": ["http://127.0.0.1:4000/mcp"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **On macOS** (typically at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude Desktop/claude_desktop_config.json`):
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "stata-mcp": {
         "command": "/path/to/mcp-proxy",
         "args": ["http://127.0.0.1:4000/mcp"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   Replace `/path/to/mcp-proxy` with the actual path you found in step 3.

5. Restart Claude Desktop

6. Claude Desktop will automatically discover the available Stata tools, allowing you to run Stata commands and analyze data directly from your conversations.

> **Note:** There is an alternative way to use Stata MCP in Claude Desktop without installing this extension. See [here](https://github.com/SepineTam/stata-mcp).

## Python Environment Management

This extension uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), a fast Python package installer built in Rust, to manage Python dependencies. Key features:

- Automatic Python setup and dependency management
- Creates isolated environments that won't conflict with your system
- Works across Windows, macOS, and Linux
- 10-100x faster than traditional pip installations

**If you encounter any UV-related errors during installation:**
1. Install UV manually:
   ```bash
   # Windows (PowerShell as Administrator)
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
   
   # macOS/Linux
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```
2. Follow the [Troubleshooting](#common-installation-issues) steps to reinstall the extension
