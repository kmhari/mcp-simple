Also available as a Streamable HTTP MCP Server by connecting to `https://app.marketplaceadpros.com/mcp`

## Installation

To add the amazon-ads-mcp-server to your MCP client of choice, add the following to the server config:

On MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

On Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

### Env Vars

- `BEARER_TOKEN`: The Bearer token you got from MarketplaceAdPros.com


### Configuration

You can use it via `npx` in your Claude Desktop configuration like this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "marketplaceadpros": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@marketplaceadpros/amazon-ads-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "BEARER_TOKEN": "abcdefghijklmnop"
      }
    }
  }
}
```


Or, if you clone the repo, you can build and use in your Claude Desktop configuration like this:


```json

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "marketplaceadpros": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/amazon-ads-mcp-server/build/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "BEARER_TOKEN": "abcdefghijklmnop"
      }
    }
  }
}
```


Or, if your client supports the Streamable HTTP MCP Servers, you can just point to the MCP endpoint at `https://app.marketplaceadpros.com/mcp`. 


```json

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "marketplaceadpros": {
      "type": "streamable-http",
      "url": "https://app.marketplaceadpros.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```


Or, configure in [LibreChat](https://www.librechat.ai/) like:
```yaml
  MAP:
    type: streamable-http
    url: https://app.marketplaceadpros.com/mcp
    headers:
      Authorization: "Bearer abcdefghijklmnop"
````


## Development

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Build the server:
```bash
npm run build
```

For development with auto-rebuild:
```bash
npm run watch
```

### Debugging

Since MCP servers communicate over stdio, debugging can be challenging. We recommend using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector), which is available as a package script:

```bash
npm run inspector
```

The Inspector will provide a URL to access debugging tools in your browser.
