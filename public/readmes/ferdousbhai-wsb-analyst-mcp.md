3. Click the hammer to see available tools
4. Access prompt templates via slash commands (e.g., `/analyze_wsb_market`)

Example queries:

## Prompt Templates

### `/analyze_wsb_market`

## Integrating with Firecrawl MCP Server

For enhanced analysis capabilities, especially when dealing with external links found in WSB posts, you can integrate this server with the [Firecrawl MCP Server](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl-mcp-server). This allows your LLM agent to not only identify links shared on WSB but also scrape and analyze the content of those linked pages.
