## Development

This project uses [nix](https://nixos.org/) to manage a development environment that can be used on Linux and macOS.

### Quick Start - Linux / macOS

1. [Install nix](https://nixos.org/download/)

2. Enable nix flakes
```bash
sudo sh -c 'echo "experimental-features = nix-command flakes" >> /etc/nix/nix.conf'
```

3. Enter dev shell
```bash
nix develop
```

4. Build project
```bash
just build-release
```

5. `mcp-guardian` and `mcp-guardian-proxy` are now in `_build/bin/` which is in `PATH` of the dev shell.

### Quick Start - Windows

1. [Install git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win) with symlink support (otherwise you will need to restore `./mcp-guardian/bindings` before building).

2. [Install rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

3. [Install nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

4. Install `yarn`.
```bash
npm install --global yarn
```

5. Install .dll dependencies. The easiest way to do this is to [install Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) and install the C++ development packages.

6. Install just
```bash
cargo install just
```

7. Enter repo root with `git-bash` (otherwise `just` won't work and you'll need to call `cargo directly`)

8. Build project
```bash
just build-release
```

### Justfile

```present just --list
