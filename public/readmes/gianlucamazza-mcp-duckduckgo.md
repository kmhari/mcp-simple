2. Configure Claude Code to use the plugin:

   ```bash
   claude mcp add duckduckgo-search -- mcp-duckduckgo
   ```

3. For global configuration (available in all projects):

   ```bash
   claude mcp add duckduckgo-search --scope global -- mcp-duckduckgo
   ```

4. Start Claude Code:

## Available Endpoints

The plugin provides the following endpoints:

### Tool: `duckduckgo_web_search`

Performs a web search using DuckDuckGo with the following parameters:

- `query` (required): The search query (max 400 characters, 50 words)
- `count` (optional, default: 10): Number of results per page (1-20)
- `page` (optional, default: 1): Page number for pagination
- `site` (optional): Limit results to a specific site (e.g., 'example.com')
- `time_period` (optional): Filter results by time period ('day', 'week', 'month', 'year')

Example usage in Claude Code:

```text
Search for "artificial intelligence latest developments"
```

### Tool: `duckduckgo_get_details`

Retrieves detailed information about a specific search result:

- `url` (required): URL of the result to get details for

Example usage in Claude Code:

```text
Get details for "https://example.com/article"
```

### Tool: `duckduckgo_related_searches`

Suggests related search queries based on the original query:

- `query` (required): Original search query (max 400 characters)
- `count` (optional, default: 5): Number of related searches to return (1-10)

Example usage in Claude Code:

```text
Find related searches for "renewable energy"
```

### Resource: `docs://search`

Provides comprehensive documentation about the search functionality.

Example usage in Claude Code:

```text
Show me the documentation for the DuckDuckGo search
```

### Prompt: `search_assistant`

Helps formulate effective search queries.

Example usage in Claude Code:

```text
Help me formulate a search query about climate change solutions
```

### Resource: `search://{query}`

Retrieves formatted search results for a specific query.

Example usage in Claude Code:

```text
Get search results for "quantum computing breakthroughs"
```

## Using the Navigation Features

The plugin provides several features to help navigate and explore search results:

### Pagination

To navigate through multiple pages of search results:

```text
Search for "climate change solutions" with 5 results per page, page 2
```

### Filtering Results

To filter results by specific site:

```text
Search for "machine learning tutorials" on "tensorflow.org"
```

To filter results by time period:

```text
Search for "latest news" from the past week
```

### Exploring Result Details

To get more information about a specific search result:

```text
Get details for "https://example.com/article-found-in-search"
```

### Finding Related Searches

To discover related search queries:

```text
Find related searches for "electric vehicles"
```

These navigation features can be combined with Claude's natural language capabilities to create a powerful search and exploration experience. For example:

```text
Search for "python machine learning libraries", then get details on the top result, and finally show me related search terms
```

## Implementation Notes

This implementation uses DuckDuckGo's public web interface and parses the HTML response to extract results. This approach is used for demonstration purposes, as DuckDuckGo does not offer an official search API. In a production environment, it's recommended to use a search service with an official API.

## Enhanced Content Extraction

The DuckDuckGo plugin includes advanced content extraction capabilities that go beyond simple search results:

### Content Extraction Features

- **Full Webpage Analysis**: Extract and parse HTML content from search result URLs
- **Intelligent Content Targeting**: Identify and extract main content areas from different types of websites
- **Rich Metadata Extraction**: Extract titles, descriptions, authors, keywords, and publication dates
- **Image Detection**: Identify and extract main images and media from webpages
- **Social Media Integration**: Detect and extract links to social media profiles
- **Content Structure Analysis**: Extract headings and sections to understand webpage organization
- **Official Source Detection**: Identify whether a source is official based on domain and content signals

### Web Spidering Capabilities

The plugin includes basic web spidering functionality:

- **Configurable Depth**: Follow links from 0 to 3 levels deep from the original URL
- **Link Limitation**: Control the maximum number of links to follow per page (1-5)
- **Domain Restriction**: Option to only follow links within the same domain
- **Related Content Discovery**: Find and analyze content related to the original search

### Using Enhanced Content Extraction

To use the enhanced content extraction features:

```text
Get details for "https://example.com/article" with spider depth 1
```

To control spidering behavior:

```text
Get details for "https://example.com/article" with spider depth 2, max links 3, same domain only
```

## Development

The project includes several utility scripts in the `scripts` directory to help with development:

- `install_dev.sh`: Sets up the development environment
- `run.sh`: Runs the MCP server with development settings
