# Requirement

This MCP server supports to query without an API key, with a limitation of 1,000 queries per day. You can also [sign up](https://www.ip2location.io/sign-up) for a free API key and enjoy up to 50,000 queries per month.

The setup also use `uv`, which can be install by following [the guide](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server#set-up-your-environment).

# Setup

Follow the steps to use this MCP server with Claude Desktop:
 1. Download the repository to your local.
 2. Setup the `uv` package manager, you can once again refer to [the guide](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server#set-up-your-environment) to do so.
 3. Make sure you have installed the Claude Desktop, if you haven't, kindly download from [here](https://claude.ai/download) for Windows and MacOS users, or follow [this guide](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/client) for Linux user.
 4. Open the `claude_desktop_config.json` in your choice of editor, if you do not having one yet, follow [this guide](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server#testing-your-server-with-claude-for-desktop) to create one.
 5. Add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ip2locationio": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/ip2locationio/src",
        "run",
        "server.py"
      ],
      "env": {
        "IP2LOCATION_API_KEY": "<YOUR API key HERE>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
 6. Remember to replace the `/path/to/ip2locationio`  path with your actual path to IP2Location.io MCP server in local.
 7. To get your API key, just [login](https://www.ip2location.io/log-in) to your dashboard and get it from there. Replaced the `<YOUR API key HERE>` in above with your actual API key.
 8. Restart the Claude Desktop after save the changes, and you should see it appear in the `Search and tools` menu.

# Usage

Just enter your query about the IP in a chat in Claude Desktop. Some of the example query will be:

- Where is the location of (IP)?
- Where is (IP) located?
- What is the coordinate of (IP)?

For instance, below is the result of the IP 8.8.8.8:

![The output of the IP 8.8.8.8](example.png "The output of the IP 8.8.8.8")

In Claude Desktop, the model will automatically generate the output based on the result returned by IP2Location.io MCP server.
