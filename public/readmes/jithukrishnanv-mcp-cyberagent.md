# MCP-CyberAgent 🛡️
MCP-CyberAgent is an **MCP-compliant AI security assistant** that connects Claude Desktop (or any MCP client) with real-world cybersecurity tools like **VirusTotal, Nmap, Shodan**, and **PowerShell**.

🔬 In this project, I’ve integrated automated hash extraction from running startup applications — enabling Claude to act like a personalized  
**AI-powered Malware Scanner**.

It supports natural language interaction to:
- Scan for malware using VirusTotal
- Discover active network services
- Gather threat intelligence from Shodan
- Test network health and connectivity

All this runs **locally** in your environment — no cloud integration required. And it's completely free.

## ⚙️ Tools & Prompts

### 🔬 VirusTotal Integration
Using PowerShell, MCP-CyberAgent extracts SHA256 hashes from startup applications and checks them against **VirusTotal’s threat database**.

> 🧠 Try asking Claude:  
> `"Scan running processes with VirusTotal"`  
> `"Check for malware in startup applications"`

---

### 🌐 Nmap Port Scanner
Scan open ports, services, and protocols on any IP using Claude.

> 🧠 Try:  
> `"Check what ports are open on 127.0.0.1"`

---

### 🌍 Shodan IP Intelligence
Get real-time internet-facing service information for any public IP address using Shodan.

> 🧠 Try:  
> `"What does Shodan know about 1.1.1.1?"`

### 🌐 Get Public IP
Query your external/public IP address.

> 🧠 Try:  
> `"What is my IP?"`

---

### 🏓 Ping Checker
Test latency and host reachability via ICMP.

> 🧠 Try:  
> `"Ping 8.8.8.8"`  
> `"Check if google.com is online"`

### ✅ Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JithukrishnanV/MCP-CyberAgent
   cd MCP-CyberAgent
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Add your API keys in `configs/api_keys.env`:**
   ```
   VT_API_KEY=your_virustotal_api_key
   SHODAN_API_KEY=your_shodan_api_key
   ```

5. **Edit Claude Desktop config:**
Claude Desktop
To set up Claude Desktop as a Ghidra MCP client, go to Claude -> Settings -> Developer -> Edit Config -> claude_desktop_config.json and add the following:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "cyberagent": {
         "command": "C:/Path/To/python.exe",
         "args": [
           ""/ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO/bridge_mcp_cyberagent.py"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

6. **Launch Claude and select the MCP-CyberAgent from the MCP tab.**
