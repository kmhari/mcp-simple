# Google Ads MCP (Node.js) - by TrueClicks

Google Ads MCP by TrueClicks enables your AI (like Claude) to securely access and query your Google Ads account data. It supports both Windows and macOS, including Intel and ARM-based systems. It connects AIs to Google Ads using [GAQL.app] as a backend.

This is an *unofficial* Google Ads MCP integration - and as of now, **no official version exists**.

## ✅ Why Use This MCP?

Unlike other open-source Multi-Client Processors (MCPs) for Google Ads, this Node.js-based MCP offers **the easiest setup experience available**:

- 🟢 **No Google Cloud Project setup required**
- 🟢 No OAuth credentials
- 🟢 No Developer Tokens
- 🟢 No Client IDs
- 🟢 No authentication hassles

Instead, it uses free **[GAQL.app](https://gaql.app)**, which securely handles authentication and query execution behind the scenes.

This makes it ideal for users who want to get up and running **within minutes**.

         ]
