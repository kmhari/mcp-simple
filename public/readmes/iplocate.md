**On macOS/Linux:**

```bash
export IPLOCATE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
npx -y @iplocate/mcp-server
```

**On Windows:**

```powershell
set IPLOCATE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
npx -y @iplocate/mcp-server
```

### Install from npm

```bash
npm install -g @iplocate/mcp-server
mcp-server-iplocate
```

### Install from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iplocate/mcp-server-iplocate.git
cd mcp-server-iplocate
yarn install
yarn build
yarn start
```

For development with auto-reload:

```bash
yarn dev
```

### Testing

You can test the server using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector):

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node dist/index.js
```
