# Utopia MCP Server

Utopia is a simulation MCP Server designed to test and experiment with common household items, both those available today and those likely to exist in the near future, using AI Agents. This project provides a set of simulated smart home and lifestyle devices, allowing you to interact with them through AI agents.

The main idea is to explore how AI agents can discover and utilize multiple MCP endpoints simultaneously to achieve complex, user-requested tasks in household environments.

In a new chat, for the prompt ```"I'm going to bed. Adjust everything by using the available tools."```, **Claude Desktop** using **Claude Sonnet 4** performs necessary MCP Server calls and ends up with the following:

```
Perfect! I've adjusted everything for a good night's sleep:
âœ… Completed adjustments:

Blinds closed - Bedroom, living room, and kitchen blinds are now closed for privacy and to block out light
Temperature set - Bedroom thermostat set to a comfortable 18Â°C for sleeping
Security confirmed - Front door is locked
All lights confirmed off - Throughout the house
Audio confirmed off - No music playing anywhere
Vacuum confirmed idle - Won't disturb your sleep

Your home is now set up perfectly for bedtime. Sweet dreams! ðŸŒ™
```
This demonstrates how AI agents can orchestrate multiple real-life devices to fulfill a complex, user-centered task.

The striking things is, we don't need to program this workflow, it is automatically discovered by the AI Agent and executed. We can give detailed instructions where necessary to make sure the agent is not confused, but for common cases like planning the going to bed scenario, the current reasoning capability of most SOTA models can be sufficient.

## How to Add to Claude Desktop

You'll need [.NET 9](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0) to build the MCP Server in your system.

To add this MCP server to Claude Desktop, add the following to your configuration:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Utopia": {
      "command": "dotnet",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--project",
        "<path_to_project_folder>/Utopia.csproj"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
