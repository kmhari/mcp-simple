## User Guide

### Getting Started

1. **Create a `.env` file:**  Copy the example `.env` file structure (shown below) into a new file named `.env` in the root of your project.
2. **Populate the `.env` file:** Fill in the necessary values for your Confluent Cloud environment.  See the [Configuration](#configuration) section for details on each variable.
3. **Install Node.js** (if not already installed)
   - We recommend using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (Node Version Manager) to manage Node.js versions
   - Install and use Node.js:

    ```bash
    nvm install 22
    nvm use 22
    ```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project with the following configuration:

#### Prerequisites & Setup for Tableflow Commands

In order to leverage **Tableflow commands** to interact with your data ecosystem and successfully execute these Tableflow commands and manage resources (e.g., interacting with data storage like AWS S3 and metadata catalogs like AWS Glue), certain **IAM (Identity and Access Management) permissions** and configurations are essential.

It is crucial to set up the necessary roles and policies in your cloud environment (e.g., AWS) and link them correctly within Confluent Cloud. This ensures your Flink SQL cluster, which powers Tableflow, has the required authorization to perform operations on your behalf.

Please refer to the following Confluent Cloud documentation for detailed instructions on setting up these permissions and integrating with custom storage and Glue:

* **Confluent Cloud Tableflow Quick Start with Custom Storage & Glue:**
    [https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/topics/tableflow/get-started/quick-start-custom-storage-glue.html](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/topics/tableflow/get-started/quick-start-custom-storage-glue.html)

Ensuring these prerequisites are met will prevent authorization errors when the `mcp-server` attempts to provision or manage Tableflow-enabled tables.

### Usage

This MCP server is designed to be used with various MCP clients, such as Claude Desktop or Goose CLI/Desktop.  The specific configuration and interaction will depend on the client you are using.  However, the general steps are:

1. **Start the Server:** You can run the MCP server in one of two ways:
   - **From source:** Follow the instructions in the [Developer Guide](#developer-guide) to build and run the server from source. This typically involves:
     - Installing dependencies (`npm install`)
     - Building the project (`npm run build` or `npm run dev`)
   - **With npx:** You can start the server directly using npx (no build required):

     ```bash
     npx -y @confluentinc/mcp-confluent -e /path/to/confluent-mcp-server/.env
     ```

2. **Configure your MCP Client:**  Each client will have its own way of specifying the MCP server's address and any required credentials.  You'll need to configure your client (e.g., Claude, Goose) to connect to the address where this server is running (likely `localhost` with a specific port). The port the server runs on may be configured by an environment variable.

3. **Start the MCP Client:**  Once your client is configured to connect to the MCP server, you can start your mcp client and on startup - it will stand up an instance of this MCP server locally.  This instance will be responsible for managing data schemas and interacting with Confluent Cloud on your behalf.

4. **Interact with Confluent through the Client:** Once the client is connected, you can use the client's interface to interact with Confluent Cloud resources.  The client will send requests to this MCP server, which will then interact with Confluent Cloud on your behalf.

### Configuring Claude Desktop

See [here](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user) for more details about installing Claude Desktop and MCP servers.

To configure Claude Desktop to use this MCP server:

1. **Open Claude Desktop Configuration**
   - On Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - On Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

2. **Edit Configuration File**
   - Open the config file in your preferred text editor
   - Add or modify the configuration using one of the following methods:

   <details>
   <summary>Option 1: Run from source</summary>

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "confluent": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": [
           "/path/to/confluent-mcp-server/dist/index.js",
            "--env-file",
           "/path/to/confluent-mcp-server/.env",
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   </details>

   <details>
   <summary>Option 2: Run from npx</summary>

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "confluent": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": [
           "-y"
           "@confluentinc/mcp-confluent",
           "-e",
           "/path/to/confluent-mcp-server/.env"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   </details>

   Replace `/path/to/confluent-mcp-server/` with the actual path where you've installed this MCP server.

1. **Restart Claude Desktop**
   - Close and reopen Claude Desktop for the changes to take effect
   - The MCP server will automatically start when Claude Desktop launches

Now Claude Desktop will be configured to use your local MCP server for Confluent interactions.

```

### Building and Running

1. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. **Development Mode (watch for changes):**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This command compiles the TypeScript code to JavaScript and automatically rebuilds when changes are detected in the `src/` directory.

3. **Production Build (one-time compilation):**

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

4. **Start the Server:**

    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```


### Docker

#### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine and Docker Compose): https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

##### Environment Variables

The MCP server requires several environment variables to connect to Confluent Cloud and other relevant services. These should be provided in the `.env` file in the root directory of this project. Or you can add them directly in the `docker-compose.yml`

#### Building and Running with Docker

Here's how to build your Docker image and run it in different modes.

1.  **Navigate to your project directory.** Open your terminal or command prompt and change to the directory containing the `Dockerfile`.

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/repo/mcp-confluent
    ```

2.  **Build the Docker image.** 

    This command creates the `mcp-server` image based on the `Dockerfile` in the current directory.

    ```bash
    docker build -t mcp-server .
    ```

3.  **Run the container** 

    * `--rm`: **Automatically removes the container** when it exits. This helps keep your system clean.
    * `-i`: Keeps **STDIN open** (runs the server using stdio transport by default).
    * `-d`: Runs the container in **detached mode** (in the background).
    * `-p 3000:3000`: **Maps port 3000** on your host machine to port 3000 inside the container. Adjust this if your app listens on a different port.

    ```bash
    docker run --rm -i -d -p 3000:3000 mcp-server
    ```
    (Optional)
    * `-t` **Transport Mode** to enable http transport
    ```bash
    docker run --rm -d -p 3000:3000 mcp-server -t http
    ```

#### Building and Running with Docker Compose

1. **Navigate to the project root:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and change to the directory containing Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml.

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/repo/mcp-confluent
    ```

2. **Build and run the service:**
    Docker Compose will build the Docker image (if not already built) and start the mcp-server service.

    ```bash 
    docker compose up --build
    ```

    The --build flag ensures that Docker Compose rebuilds the image before starting the container. You can omit this flag on subsequent runs if you haven't changed the Dockerfile or source code.

    The server will be accessible on http://localhost:3000 (or the port specified in HTTP_PORT in your .env file).

3. **Stopping the Server**
    To stop the running MCP server and remove the containers, press Ctrl+C in the terminal where docker compose up is running.

    Alternatively, in a new terminal from the project root, you can run:

    ```bash 
    docker compose down
    ```

    This command stops and removes the containers, networks, and volumes created by docker compose up.


### Testing

#### MCP Inspector

For testing MCP servers, you can use [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) which is an interactive developer tool for testing and debugging MCP servers.

```bash
# make sure you've already built the project either in dev mode or by running npm run build
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node  $PATH_TO_PROJECT/dist/index.js --env-file $PATH_TO_PROJECT/.env
```

### Adding a New Tool

1. Add a new enum to the enum class `ToolName`.
2. Add your new tool to the handlers map in the `ToolFactory` class.
3. Create a new file, exporting the class that extends `BaseToolHandler`.
    1. Implement the `handle` method of the base class.
    2. Implement the `getToolConfig` method of the base class.
4. Once satisfied, add it to the set of `enabledTools` in `index.ts`.

### Generating Types

```bash
# as of v7.5.2 there is a bug when using allOf w/ required https://github.com/openapi-ts/openapi-typescript/issues/1474. need --empty-objects-unknown flag to avoid it
npx openapi-typescript ./openapi.json -o ./src/confluent/openapi-schema.d.ts --empty-objects-unknown
```
