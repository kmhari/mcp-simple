# Flatfile MCP Server

The Flatfile MCP Server enables AI assistants such as Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, and other to interact directly with your Flatfile data. This MCP Server creates a seamless bridge between AI assistants and Flatfile.

## ‚ú® Features

- Supports 100+ Flatfile API endpoints
- View and manage Sheets, Workbooks, Spaces, and more
- Add, edit, and delete Records
- Ask questions about your data
- Generate Sheets from natural language
- Create new Workbooks from scratch
- And more!

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

You will need either a Flatfile Personal Access Token or a Flatfile API Key.

### API Key

Access your API Key by [following these instructions](https://flatfile.com/docs/documentation/authentication/authentication).

### Personal Access Token

Create a Flatfile Personal Access Token by [following these instructions](https://flatfile.com/docs/documentation/authentication/account-token#personal-access-tokens).

### Filtering Tools

Flatfile provides over 100 API endpoints, with a tool to interact with each of them. It is strongly recommended to filter the tools to only include the ones you need. This can be done by passing the `--enabled-tools` flag to the MCP Server along with a comma-separated list of the tools you want to enable. If the `--enabled-tools` flag is not passed, all tools will be enabled.

Example:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
      // ...
      "mcp-server-flatfile": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "@flatfile/mcp-server", "--enabled-tools", "getRecords,updateRecords"],
         // ...
      }
      // ...
  }
}
```

### Usage with Claude Desktop

Add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-server-flatfile": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@flatfile/mcp-server", "--enabled-tools", "..."], // Replace with the tools you want to enable
      "env": {
        "FLATFILE_BEARER_TOKEN": "pat_your_token_here",
        "FLATFILE_API_URL": "https://platform.flatfile.com/api/v1" // Optional, for non-US regions or self-hosting
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Usage with Claude Code

Add the following to your `.claude/code/config.json`:

```bash
claude mcp add mcp-server-flatfile -e FLATFILE_API_URL=https://platform.flatfile.com/api/v1 -e FLATFILE_BEARER_TOKEN=pat_your_token_here -- npx -y @flatfile/mcp-server --enabled-tools ... // Replace with the tools you want to enable
```
