# Polymarket MCP - Prediction Market Tools

A collection of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for interacting with prediction markets, specifically designed to work with Claude Desktop and other AI assistants.

## 🌟 Features

- **Real-time market data** from Polymarket API
- **Multiple server implementations** with varying complexity
- **Seamless integration** with Claude Desktop
- **Custom data analysis tools** for prediction markets
- **Synthetic data generation** for testing and demonstration

## 📋 Project Overview

This project provides MCP server implementations for prediction market data:

1. **Enhanced Server (v3)** - The main implementation with real-time Polymarket API integration, data analysis, and market insights.
2. **Core API Library** - Reusable components for building custom prediction market tools.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- [Claude Desktop](https://anthropic.com/claude) (for using the tools with Claude)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Mcp-polymarket.git
   cd Mcp-polymarket
   ```

2. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup.sh
   ```
   
   This will:
   - Create a virtual environment
   - Install dependencies
   - Set up configuration files
   - Provide Claude Desktop configuration instructions

### Running the Server

Use the provided script to start the server:
```bash
./scripts/start_server.sh
```

Or run it manually:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python3 enhanced_server_v3.py
```

## 🛠️ Available Tools

### Enhanced Server (v3)

1. **getMarkets** - Retrieve current prediction markets with filtering options
2. **refreshMarkets** - Force refresh the market data from the API
3. **analyzeMarket** - Get detailed analysis for a specific market

## 📊 Data Sources

The server can use multiple data sources:

1. **Polymarket API** - Real-time data from the Polymarket platform
2. **Synthetic Data** - Generated market data for testing and demonstration
3. **Local Cache** - Stored data for faster response times

## 🔧 Configuration

### Claude Desktop Configuration

Add the following to your Claude Desktop configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "polymarket-mcp": {
      "command": "sh",
      "args": [
        "-c",
        "cd /Onfinance-MCP-Polymarket && source .venv/bin/activate && PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 python src/polymarket_mcp/server.py 2>/tmp/polymarket_server.log"
      ],
      "restartOnExit": true,
      "maxRestarts": 5
    }
  }
} 
```

The configuration file can be found at:
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

## 📜 Available Scripts

The project includes several utility scripts in the `scripts` directory:

- `setup.sh` - Sets up the project environment (virtual env, dependencies, etc.)
- `start_server.sh` - Starts the server and shows live logs
- Other utility scripts for specific purposes

To run any script:
```bash
./scripts/script_name.sh
```

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Querying Markets with Claude

Once the server is running and configured in Claude Desktop, you can use the tools with queries like:

```
Can you show me the latest prediction markets related to US elections?
```

Claude will use the `getMarkets` tool with appropriate filters.

### Market Analysis

```
Analyze the market with ID "pm-123456" and give me your insights.
```

Claude will use the `analyzeMarket` tool to provide detailed market analysis.
