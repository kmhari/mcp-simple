# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server for Graphlit Platform

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server enables integration between MCP clients and the Graphlit service. This document outlines the setup process and provides a basic example of using the client.

Ingest anything from Slack, Discord, websites, Google Drive, email, Jira, Linear or GitHub into a Graphlit project - and then search and retrieve relevant knowledge within an MCP client like Cursor, Windsurf, Goose or Cline.

Your Graphlit project acts as a searchable, and RAG-ready knowledge base across all your developer and product management tools.

Documents (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, etc.) and HTML web pages will be extracted to Markdown upon ingestion. Audio and video files will be transcribed upon ingestion.

Web crawling and web search are built-in as MCP tools, with no need to integrate other tools like Firecrawl, Exa, etc. separately.

You can read more about the MCP Server use cases and features on our [blog](https://www.graphlit.com/blog/graphlit-mcp-server).

Watch our latest [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or-QqonvcAs&t=4s) on using the Graphlit MCP Server with the Goose MCP client.

For any questions on using the MCP Server, please join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ygFmfjy3Qx) community and post on the #mcp channel.
