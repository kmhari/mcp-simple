```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ares-devops-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "ares-devops-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "AZURE_DEVOPS_ORG": "your-organization",
        "AZURE_DEVOPS_PROJECT": "your-project",
        "AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT": "your-pat-token"
      },
      "disabled": false,
