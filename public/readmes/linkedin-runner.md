Create posts. Analyze what’s working. Rewrite in your voice. 
All from Claude or ChatGPT, powered by your own past posts.

## What is this?

This is the official runner repo for **LiGo’s Model Context Protocol (MCP)** - a protocol that lets GPT-based assistants pull your LinkedIn context and respond like a strategist. It works with both Claude and ChatGPT.

With MCP, your assistant can answer things like:
- Which of your last posts got the most traction
- What your writing tone actually sounds like
- How to help you post, rewrite, or brainstorm like a founder

Just talk to it normally (if you know how to do that - no judging if you don't, btw). It has access to all your PUBLIC Linkedin data (with your consent, of course).

## How to Get Started

### Claude Setup

2. Visit [ligo.ertiqah.com/integrations/claude](https://ligo.ertiqah.com/integrations/claude)
3. Click **"Generate Installation Command"**
   - If not logged in, you’ll be routed to authenticate with LiGo
4. Copy the command and run it in your terminal
5. Open Claude and start chatting

Example prompt:
> Analyze my last 5 posts. What’s working? Give me ideas on what I should write next.

### ChatGPT (CustomGPT)

No installation needed.

1. Go to [ligo.ertiqah.com/integrations/chatgpt](https://ligo.ertiqah.com/integrations/chatgpt)

## See It in Action: [MCP Leaderboard](https://ligo.ertiqah.com/mcp-leaderboard)

We showcase the **latest 50 posts** made using the MCP integration, complete with:
- The full post
- A link to the original LinkedIn post
- The author’s name

This acts like a public feed. It’s a live demo. And yes, it creates some healthy FOMO + you get a permanent backlink to your post. SEO goes brrrr.

## Why It Matters

Honestly, it's a bit of a pain keeping your GPT/Claude Project up to date with your Linkedin activity (assuming you even have one).

We thought: "Wouldn't it be nice if GPT could connect to our Linkedin profile so I could just tell it to go look at it?" 

And then this happened. 

But, that's not all.

It’s part of the broader [LiGo platform](https://ligo.ertiqah.com), which covers commenting, analytics, CRM, and more. Go check it out.
