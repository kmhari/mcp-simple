# Model Context Protocol TypeScript Implementation

## Overview
This project implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a practical embodiment of the Personal Intelligence Framework (PIF). Through structured tools and progressive interaction patterns, it creates spaces for meaningful development of understanding between humans and AI.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- TypeScript 5.0+
- Model Context Protocol TypeScript SDK
- Claude Desktop Client configured for custom servers

> **Note**: This implementation has been tested on both Windows and macOS/Linux systems.

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/hungryrobot1/MCP-PIF]
cd mcp-pif
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure the server:
   - Configuration is now auto-detected by default, but you can customize:
     - Set the `MCP_WORKSPACE_ROOT` environment variable to specify a workspace location
     - Or set the `MCP_CONFIG` environment variable with a JSON string of configuration options
     - Or directly edit `src/config.ts` to modify the default configuration

4. Build the server:
```bash
npm run build
```

5. Configure Claude Desktop Client:
   - Locate your Claude Desktop Client configuration directory
   - Create or modify `claude_desktop_config.json`:
     ```json
     {
         "mcpServers": {
             "mcp-pif": {
                 "command": "node",
                 "args": ["path/to/your/mcp-pif/build/index.js"],
                 "cwd": "path/to/your/mcp-pif",
                 "env": {}
             }
         }
     }
     ```
   - Replace `path/to/your/mcp-pif` with your actual repository path
   - Paths are automatically normalized for your operating system

6. Connect Claude Desktop Client:
   - Start or restart the Claude Desktop Client
   - Select "mcp-pif" as your custom server
   - Start a new chat to begin using the server

### Directory Structure
The server will create and manage the following structure in your configured workspace:
```
workspace/
├── home/
│   ├── meta/
│   │   └── journal/     # For storing journal entries
│   └── projects/        # For user projects
```

### Next Steps
- Review the [Module Documentation](home/meta/docs/modules/) for available tools
- Explore the [Architecture Guide](home/meta/docs/architecture/) for implementation details
- Check the [Development Guide](home/meta/docs/architecture/development.md) for contribution guidelines

### Troubleshooting
- If manually specifying paths, use platform-appropriate separators (backslashes on Windows, forward slashes on macOS/Linux)
- Check the Claude Desktop Client logs if connection fails
- Verify your workspace directory exists and is writable
- Make sure Node.js and TypeScript versions meet requirements

## Core Implementation

### Available Tools
The implementation provides a set of core tools designed to support structured interaction:

- **Filesystem Operations**: Navigate and manage workspace context
  - `pwd`, `cd`, `read`, `write`, `mkdir`, `delete`, `move`, `rename`
- **Reasoning Tools**: Create spaces for structured thought
  - `reason`: Develop connected insights
  - `think`: Create temporal spaces for contemplation
- **Journal System**: Maintain framework continuity
  - `journal_create`: Document developments
  - `journal_read`: Explore patterns

### Basic Usage
```typescript
// Create a structured thought pattern
reason: {
    thoughts: [
        { content: "Initial observation" },
        {
            content: "Building on previous thought",
            relationType: "sequence",
            relationTo: 0
        }
    ]
}

// Document development
journal_create: {
    title: "Implementation Pattern",
    content: "Insights about development...",
    tags: ["development", "patterns"]
}
```

## Cross-Platform Support

The MCP-PIF server is designed to work seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux environments:

### Path Handling
- All file paths are automatically normalized for the current operating system
- The workspace root is detected automatically based on the current environment
- Both absolute and relative paths are supported within the workspace

### Configuration
- Environment variables provide a cross-platform way to configure the server
- File operations use Node.js path methods to ensure consistent behavior
- Journal entries and other data are stored in a platform-independent format

### Development Workflow
- NPM scripts work on all platforms
- TypeScript compilation produces platform-agnostic JavaScript
- Error handling accounts for platform-specific file system behaviors

## Implementation Framework

### Module Architecture
The system is built around modular tools that create conditions for structured emergence:
```
src/
├── core/          # Framework foundations
├── mcp_modules/   # Tool implementations
└── api/           # External integrations
```

### Tool Patterns
Each tool follows consistent patterns while maintaining its unique role:
- Clear interface definitions
- Structured error handling
- State management
- Cross-module interaction

### Development Environment
- TypeScript for type safety
- Module-based organization
- Comprehensive logging
- Workspace context management

## Theoretical Foundation

### Personal Intelligence Framework
The PIF represents a new approach to human-AI collaboration based on:
- Creating conditions for structured emergence
- Maintaining framework-based continuity
- Supporting progressive development
- Enabling meaningful interaction

### Structured Emergence
Rather than prescribing fixed patterns, the implementation creates bounded spaces where understanding can emerge through:
- Tool-mediated interaction
- Relationship structures
- Temporal spaces
- Progressive development

### Framework-Based Continuity
Understanding develops through:
- Structured documentation
- Pattern discovery
- Historical context
- Evolutionary development

### Progressive Disclosure
The system supports different levels of engagement:
- Immediate practical usage
- Pattern discovery
- Framework evolution
- Philosophical alignment

## Development Paths

For those primarily interested in practical implementation:
1. Start with basic tool usage
2. Explore module documentation
3. Develop interaction patterns
4. Discover emerging capabilities

### Framework Developer
For those interested in extending the system:
1. Review module architecture
2. Understand tool patterns

- [Development Guide](home/meta/docs/architecture/development.md): Implementation patterns

## Future Directions
The project continues to evolve through:
- New tool development
- Pattern discovery
- Framework refinement
- Community engagement

## Philosophy
This implementation embodies a view where:
- Understanding emerges through structured interaction
- Tools create spaces for new patterns
- Development itself becomes philosophical inquiry
- Human and AI intelligence co-evolve

## Notes on Usage
The system is more than a set of tools - it is a space for exploring how human and AI intelligence can develop through structured interaction. Each session is an opportunity to discover new patterns of understanding and collaboration.
