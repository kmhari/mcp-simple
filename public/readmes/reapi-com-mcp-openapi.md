# @reapi/mcp-openapi

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that loads and serves multiple OpenAPI specifications to enable LLM-powered IDE integrations. This server acts as a bridge between your OpenAPI specifications and LLM-powered development tools like Cursor and other code editors.

## Features

- Loads multiple OpenAPI specifications from a directory
- Exposes API operations and schemas through MCP protocol
- Enables LLMs to understand and work with your APIs directly in your IDE
- Supports dereferenced schemas for complete API context
- Maintains a catalog of all available APIs

## Cursor Configuration

To integrate the MCP OpenAPI server with Cursor IDE, you have two options for configuration locations:

### Option 1: Project-specific Configuration (Recommended)
Create a `.cursor/mcp.json` file in your project directory. This option is recommended as it allows you to maintain different sets of specs for different projects

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "@reapi/mcp-openapi": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@reapi/mcp-openapi@latest", "--dir", "./specs"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

> **Tip**: Using a relative path like `./specs` makes the configuration portable and easier to share across team members.
> 
> **Note**: We recommend using `@latest` tag as we frequently update the server with new features and improvements.
>
> **Important**: Project-specific configuration helps manage LLM context limits. When all specifications are placed in a single folder, the combined metadata could exceed the LLM's context window, leading to errors. Organizing specs by project keeps the context size manageable.

### Option 2: Global Configuration
Create or edit `~/.cursor/mcp.json` in your home directory to make the server available across all projects:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "@reapi/mcp-openapi": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@reapi/mcp-openapi@latest", "--dir", "/path/to/your/specs"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

### Enable in Cursor Settings

After adding the configuration:

1. Open Cursor IDE
2. Go to Settings > Cursor Settings > MCP
3. Enable the @reapi/mcp-openapi server
4. Click the refresh icon next to the server to apply changes

> **Note**: By default, Cursor requires confirmation for each MCP tool execution. If you want to allow automatic execution without confirmation, you can enable [Yolo mode](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#yolo-mode) in Cursor settings.

The server is now ready to use. When you add new OpenAPI specifications to your directory, you can refresh the catalog by:

1. Opening Cursor's chat panel
2. Typing one of these prompts:
   ```
   "Please refresh the API catalog"
   "Reload the OpenAPI specifications"
   ```

### OpenAPI Specification Requirements

1. Place your OpenAPI 3.x specifications in the target directory:
   - Supports both JSON and YAML formats
   - Files should have `.json`, `.yaml`, or `.yml` extensions
   - Scanner will automatically discover and process all specification files

2. Specification ID Configuration:
   - By default, the filename (without extension) is used as the specification ID
   - To specify a custom ID, add `x-spec-id` in the OpenAPI info object:
   ```yaml
   openapi: 3.0.0
   info:
     title: My API
     version: 1.0.0
     x-spec-id: my-custom-api-id  # Custom specification ID
   ```
   
   > **Important**: Setting a custom `x-spec-id` is crucial when working with multiple specifications that have:
   > - Similar or identical endpoint paths
   > - Same schema names
   > - Overlapping operation IDs
   >
   > The spec ID helps distinguish between these similar resources and prevents naming conflicts. For example:
   > ```yaml
   > # user-service.yaml
   > info:
   >   x-spec-id: user-service
   > paths:
   >   /users:
   >     get: ...
   > 
   > # admin-service.yaml
   > info:
   >   x-spec-id: admin-service
   > paths:
   >   /users:
   >     get: ...
   > ```
   > Now you can reference these endpoints specifically as `user-service/users` and `admin-service/users`

## How It Works

1. The server scans the specified directory for OpenAPI specification files
2. It processes and dereferences the specifications for complete context
3. Creates and maintains a catalog of all API operations and schemas
4. Exposes this information through the MCP protocol
5. IDE integrations can then use this information to:
   - Provide API context to LLMs
   - Enable intelligent code completion
   - Assist in API integration
   - Generate API-aware code snippets
