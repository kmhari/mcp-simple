# MCP Klaudium

An enhanced MCP memory server with dynamic compression, context management and thinking process integration. Based on the original MCP memory server.

## Core Features

### Basic Knowledge Graph Functionality
- Entities with observations
- Relations between entities
- Basic CRUD operations
- Search capabilities

### Enhanced Memory Management
- **Temporal Awareness**
  - Timestamps for entities and relations
  - Enables time-based analysis and compression

- **Memory Importance Tracking**
  - Importance scoring for entities
  - Helps prioritize memory retention

- **Categorization System**
  - Category field for better organization
  - Improved memory structure

- **Memory Statistics**
  - Track total entities and relations
  - Monitor memory size in tokens
  - Observation counting

### Coming Soon
- Dynamic memory compression system
- Context-aware memory management
- Thinking process integration
- Advanced memory categorization
- Memory summarization
