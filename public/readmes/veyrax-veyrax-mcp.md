## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

### Introduction
VeyraX MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open protocol that allows you to provide custom tools to agentic LLMs. By connecting once to the VeyraX platform, you can use all tools you’ve already integrated with VeyraX in any MCP-compatible environment—such as **Claude**, **Cursor**, **VS Code**, or **Windserf**—without juggling multiple authentications.

### Why Choose VeyraX?
- **Single Authentication**: Connect once in VeyraX, then use your tools across all MCP clients without separate logins or credentials.
- **Instant Access to All Tools**: Any tool you connect to VeyraX is immediately available in your favorite editor or AI assistant.
- **5-Minute Setup**: Connect VeyraX to any MCP client in under five minutes.
