## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or later
- macOS (required for Apple Reminders integration)

## Quick Start

Install globally via npm:

```bash
npm install -g mcp-server-apple-reminders
```

## Configuration

### Configure Cursor

1. Open Cursor
2. Open Cursor settings
3. Click on "MCP" in the sidebar
4. Click "Add new global MCP server"
5. Configure the server with the following settings:
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "apple-reminders": {
          "command": "mcp-server-apple-reminders",
          "args": []
        }
      }
    }
    ```

### Configure ChatWise

1. Open ChatWise
2. Go to Settings
3. Navigate to the Tools section
4. Click the "+" button
5. Configure the tool with the following settings:
   - Type: `stdio`
   - ID: `apple-reminders`
   - Command: `mcp-server-apple-reminders`
   - Args: (leave empty)

### Configure Claude Desktop

You need to configure Claude Desktop to recognize the Apple Reminders MCP server. There are two ways to access the configuration:

#### Option 1: Through Claude Desktop UI

1. Open Claude Desktop app
2. Enable Developer Mode from the top-left menu bar
3. Open Settings and navigate to the Developer Option
4. Click the Edit Config button to open `claude_desktop_config.json`

#### Option 2: Direct File Access

For macOS:
```bash
code ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

For Windows:
```bash
code %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
```

### 2. Add Server Configuration

Add the following configuration to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "apple-reminders": {
      "command": "mcp-server-apple-reminders",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Restart Claude Desktop

For the changes to take effect:

1. Completely quit Claude Desktop (not just close the window)
2. Start Claude Desktop again
3. Look for the tool icon to verify the Apple Reminders server is connected

## Usage Examples

Once configured, you can ask Claude to interact with your Apple Reminders. Here are some example prompts:

### Creating Reminders
```
Create a reminder to "Buy groceries" for tomorrow at 5 PM.
Add a reminder to "Call mom" with a note "Ask about weekend plans".
Create a reminder in my "Work" list to "Submit report" due next Friday.
```


### Update Reminders
```
Update the reminder "Buy groceries" with a new title "Buy organic groceries".
Update "Call mom" reminder to be due today at 6 PM.
Update the reminder "Submit report" and mark it as completed.
Change the notes on "Buy groceries" to "Don't forget milk and eggs".
```

### Managing Reminders
```
Show me all my reminders.
List all reminders in my "Shopping" list.
Show my completed reminders.
```

### Working with Lists
```
Show all my reminder lists.
Show reminders from my "Work" list.
```

The server will:
- Process your natural language requests
- Interact with Apple's native Reminders app
- Return formatted results to Claude
- Maintain native integration with macOS
