This VS Code extension provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes VSCode's powerful development tools and language features to AI tools. It enables advanced code navigation, analysis, and manipulation capabilities when using AI coding assistants that support the MCP protocol.

## Features

- **Language Server Integration**: Access VSCode's language server capabilities for any supported language
- **Code Navigation**: Find references, definitions, implementations, and more
- **Symbol Search**: Search for symbols across your workspace
- **Code Analysis**: Get semantic tokens, document symbols, and type information
- **Smart Selection**: Use semantic selection ranges for intelligent code selection
- **Code Actions**: Access refactoring suggestions and quick fixes
- **HTTP/SSE Server**: Exposes language features over an MCP-compatible HTTP server
- **AI Assistant Integration**: Ready to work with AI assistants that support the MCP protocol

## Usage

### Installation

1. Install [the extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ConnorHallman.bifrost-mcp) from the VS Code marketplace
2. Install any language-specific extensions you need for your development
3. Open your project in VS Code

### Configuration

The extension will automatically start an MCP server when activated. To configure an AI assistant to use this server:

1. The server runs on port 8008 by default (configurable with `bifrost.config.json`)
2. Configure your MCP-compatible AI assistant to connect to:
   - SSE endpoint: `http://localhost:8008/sse`
   - Message endpoint: `http://localhost:8008/message`

### LLM Rules
I have also provided sample rules that can be used in .cursorrules files for better results.

### Cline Installation
- Step 1. Install [Supergateway](https://github.com/supercorp-ai/supergateway)
- Step 2. Add config to cline
- Step 3. It will show up red but seems to work fine

#### Windows Config
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Bifrost": {
      "command": "cmd",
      "args": [
        "/c",
        "npx",
        "-y",
        "supergateway",
        "--sse",
        "http://localhost:8008/sse"
      ],
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": [],
      "timeout": 600
    }
  }
}
```

#### Mac/Linux Config
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Bifrost": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "supergateway",
        "--sse",
        "http://localhost:8008/sse"
      ],
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": [],
      "timeout": 600
    }
  }
}
```

### Roo Code Installation
- Step 1: Add the SSE config to your global or project-based MCP configuration
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Bifrost": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8008/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

Follow this video to install and use with cursor

#### FOR NEW VERSIONS OF CURSOR, USE THIS CODE
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Bifrost": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8008/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

## Multiple Project Support

When working with multiple projects, each project can have its own dedicated MCP server endpoint and port. This is useful when you have multiple VS Code windows open or are working with multiple projects that need language server capabilities.

### Project Configuration

Create a `bifrost.config.json` file in your project root:

```json
{
    "projectName": "MyProject",
    "description": "Description of your project",
    "path": "/my-project",
    "port": 5642
}
```

The server will use this configuration to:
- Create project-specific endpoints (e.g., `http://localhost:5642/my-project/sse`)
- Provide project information to AI assistants
- Use a dedicated port for each project
- Isolate project services from other running instances

### Example Configurations

1. Backend API Project:
```json
{
    "projectName": "BackendAPI",
    "description": "Node.js REST API with TypeScript",
    "path": "/backend-api",
    "port": 5643
}
```

2. Frontend Web App:
```json
{
    "projectName": "FrontendApp",
    "description": "React frontend application",
    "path": "/frontend-app",
    "port": 5644
}
```

### Port Configuration

Each project should specify its own unique port to avoid conflicts when multiple VS Code instances are running:

- The `port` field in `bifrost.config.json` determines which port the server will use
- If no port is specified, it defaults to 8008 for backwards compatibility
- Choose different ports for different projects to ensure they can run simultaneously
- The server will fail to start if the configured port is already in use, requiring you to either:
  - Free up the port
  - Change the port in the config
  - Close the other VS Code instance using that port

### Connecting to Project-Specific Endpoints

Update your AI assistant configuration to use the project-specific endpoint and port:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "BackendAPI": {
      "url": "http://localhost:5643/backend-api/sse"
    },
    "FrontendApp": {
      "url": "http://localhost:5644/frontend-app/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

### Backwards Compatibility

If no `bifrost.config.json` is present, the server will use the default configuration:
- Port: 8008
- SSE endpoint: `http://localhost:8008/sse`
- Message endpoint: `http://localhost:8008/message`

This maintains compatibility with existing configurations and tools.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Ensure you have the appropriate language extensions installed for your project
2. Check that your project has loaded correctly in VSCode
3. Verify that port 8008 is available on your system
4. Check the VSCode output panel for any error messages

## Contributing
Here are [Vscodes commands](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/api/references/commands.md?plain=1) if you want to add additional functionality go ahead. I think we still need rename and a few others.
