[Website](https://systemprompt.io) | [Documentation](https://systemprompt.io/documentation) | [Blog](https://tyingshoelaces.com) | [Get API Key](https://systemprompt.io/console)

A specialized Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables you to search, read, delete and send emails from your Gmail account, leveraging an AI Agent to help with each operation. The server is designed to work with the [multimodal-mcp-client](https://github.com/Ejb503/multimodal-mcp-client), a voice-powered MCP client that provides the frontend interface.

An API KEY is required to use this server. This is currently free, although this may change in the future. You can get one [here](https://systemprompt.io/console).

This server uses Sampling and Notification functionality from the [@modelcontextprotocol/sdk](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/sdk).

This will only work with advanced MCP clients that support these features.

## Required Client

This server is designed to work with the [multimodal-mcp-client](https://github.com/Ejb503/multimodal-mcp-client) - a voice-powered MCP client that provides the frontend interface. Please make sure to set up both components for the full functionality.

## Why Use This Server?

## Installation

This server requires GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS and GOOGLE_TOKEN environment variables to be set. These must be base64 encoded strings of the credentials and token. There is a script to help with this in the [multimodal-mcp-client](https://github.com/Ejb503/multimodal-mcp-client) repository. Follow the instructions here: https://github.com/Ejb503/multimodal-mcp-client/blob/master/scripts/google-auth/README.md

After generating your base64 encoded strings, you can run the server with npx.
