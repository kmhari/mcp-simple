# üç† YAMCP - A Model Context Workspace Manager

YAMCP (YAM-C-P) is a command-line tool for organizing and managing MCP servers as local workspaces. It seamlessly connects to multiple MCP servers, local or remote, grouping them into a unified workspace exposed as Yet Another MCP server (YAM) for AI applications. You can create dedicated workspaces based on specific functionality (e.g., a YAM workspace for coding, design, research, ...) or based on the AI apps that consume servers (e.g., a YAM for Cursor, Claude, Windsurf) or any other combination in between. In addition, it simplifies monitoring and debugging MCP servers by centralizing all server communication logs in a single store, eliminating the need to dig through each AI client app‚Äôs logs separately.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Install YAMCP
npm install -g yamcp  # or use npx yamcp

# Import servers (choose one)
yamcp server import [config]    # import servers from config file (see src/example-servers.json for format)
yamcp server add                # or add manually

# create workspaces (e.g. a yam for coding, design, data, ...)
yamcp yam create

# Run workspace in your AI app
yamcp run <yam-workspace-name>
```

## üîë Key Concepts

- **MCP Servers**: Remote or local servers that provide Model Context Protocol services
- **Workspaces (YAMs)**: Collections of MCP servers grouped together to be shared with AI Apps (e.g. a workspace for coding, writing, design, magic making!)
- **Gateway**: A local MCP server that manages connections to configured MCP servers in a workspace and exposes them through a unified server to AI App's MCP clients

With YAMCP, you can:

- Create workspaces to group MCP servers by AI application (e.g. Cursor, Claude, GitHub Copilot)
- Group servers by workflow purpose (e.g. software development, data science, technical writing)
- Connect AI apps to a single gateway that provides access to all workspace servers
- Manage and monitor multiple MCP server connections through a unified interface
- Track all server communications with detailed logging and debugging capabilities

## Top-Level Commands

```bash
yamcp [command] [subcommand] [flags]
```

Available top-level commands:

- `server` - Manage MCP providers
- `yam` - Manage workspaces (yams)
- `run` - Run the gateway with a workspace
- `log` - View the server log location

```

### Runtime Commands

```bash
yamcp run <yam-workspace-name>   # Start the gateway with specified workspace
yamcp log                    # View server communication logs
```

## üñ•Ô∏è YAMCP UI (created by [@eladcandroid](https://github.com/eladcandroid))
[YAMCP UI](https://github.com/eladcandroid/yamcp-ui) provides an intuitive web interface to manage your MCP servers and workspaces through a universal dashboard.

```bash
# Run directly with npx (recommended)
npx yamcp-ui

# Or install globally
npm install -g yamcp-ui
yamcp-ui
```
