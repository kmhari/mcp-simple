## 📋 Requirements

- **macOS**: Required for iOS simulator support
- **Node.js**: v14.0.0 or higher
- **Homebrew**: Required for installing dependencies
- **XCode**: With iOS simulators installed

## 🚀 Installation

The easiest way to install this server is through Cline:

1. Simply ask Cline:
```
Add this mcp to cline https://github.com/InditexTech/mcp-server-simulator-ios-idb
```

2. Cline will handle the installation process automatically, including dependency management and configuration.

Alternatively, you can install it manually:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/InditexTech/mcp-server-simulator-ios-idb.git
cd mcp-server-simulator-ios-idb

# Create and activate Python virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Start the project
npm start

# Run tests
npm test
```

The installation process will automatically:
1. Check if you're running macOS
2. Install idb-companion via Homebrew
3. Install fb-idb via pip in the virtual environment

Note: Make sure to keep the virtual environment activated while using the server. If you close your terminal and come back later, you'll need to reactivate the virtual environment with the `source venv/bin/activate` command before running `npm start`.

## 🔌 MCP Integration

To use this server with Claude or other LLM assistants:

1. Add the server to your MCP settings in Claude Desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ios-simulator": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/mcp-server-simulator-ios-idb/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

2. The LLM can now use natural language commands to control iOS simulators:

```
create a simulator session with iPhone 14
install app /path/to/my-app.ipa
launch app com.example.myapp
tap at 100, 200
take a screenshot
```

## 📚 Usage as a Library

You can also use this package as a library in your own projects:

### 🔰 Basic Usage

```typescript
import { createMCPServer } from 'mcp-server-simulator-ios-idb';

async function main() {
  // Create an instance of the MCP server
  const { orchestrator } = createMCPServer();
  
  // Process natural language commands
  
  // Create a simulator session
  const sessionResult = await orchestrator.processInstruction('create session');
  console.log(`Session created: ${sessionResult.data}`);
  
  // Interact with the simulator
  await orchestrator.processInstruction('tap at 100, 200');
  
  // Capture a screenshot
  const screenshotResult = await orchestrator.processInstruction('take screenshot');
  console.log(`Screenshot saved at: ${screenshotResult.data}`);
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

### 🚀 Advanced Usage

You can also use the individual components directly:

```typescript
import { 
  IDBManager, 
  NLParser, 
  MCPOrchestrator,
  ParserToOrchestrator,
  OrchestratorToIDB
} from 'mcp-server-simulator-ios-idb';

// Create instances
const idbManager = new IDBManager();
const parser = new NLParser();
const orchestrator = new MCPOrchestrator(parser, idbManager);

// Use the components directly
const sessionId = await idbManager.createSimulatorSession({
  deviceName: 'iPhone 12',
  platformVersion: '15.0'
});

await idbManager.tap(sessionId, 100, 200);
```

## 🔍 Architecture

The server consists of three main components:

1. **IDBManager**: Low-level component that interacts directly with iOS simulators through idb.
2. **NLParser**: Component that interprets natural language instructions and converts them into structured commands.
3. **MCPOrchestrator**: Central component that coordinates interactions between the parser and the IDBManager.

These components are connected through adapters:
- **ParserToOrchestrator**: Converts parser results into orchestrator commands.
- **OrchestratorToIDB**: Translates orchestrator commands into IDBManager calls.

## 🔌 MCP Integration

To use this server with the Model Context Protocol:

1. Add the server to your MCP settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ios-simulator": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/mcp-server-simulator-ios-idb/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

2. Connect to the server in your LLM application:

```typescript
const result = await useMcpTool({
  serverName: "ios-simulator",
  toolName: "process-instruction",
  arguments: {
    instruction: "create simulator session"
  }
});
```
