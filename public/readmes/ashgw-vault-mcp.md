# HashiCorp Vault MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation that provides a secure interface to HashiCorp Vault which enables LLMs and other MCP clients to interact with Vault's secret and policy management features.

## Overview

This allows you to prompt an LLM to:

- Secure secret management through structured API
- Policy creation and management
- Resource discovery and listing
- Automated policy generation

## Installation

There are multiple ways to use this server depending on your setup.

### Cursor (recommended)

Add this to your Cursor MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Vault MCP": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e",
        "VAULT_ADDR=https://your-vault-server:8200",
        "-e",
        "VAULT_TOKEN=hvs.your-vault-token",
        "ashgw/vault-mcp:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

> If you prefer pinning to a specific docker image build (e.g. 20250413-165732), use that tag instead of latest. Browse available versions on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ashgw/vault-mcp/tags).

Once added, you can use prompts like:

> "Read the secret at path `apps/myapp/config` from Vault"

Cursor will route that request through the MCP server automatically.

Check if it works, it should be green

### Docker (manual)

You can run Vault MCP manually via Docker:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name vault-mcp \
  -e VAULT_ADDR=https://your-vault-server:8200 \
  -e VAULT_TOKEN=hvs.your-vault-token \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  ashgw/vault-mcp
```

This uses the pre-built image published at [ashgw/vault-mcp](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ashgw/vault-mcp).

---

### Repo

Clone the repository and `cd` into it, then build with

```
docker build -t vault-mcp .
```

Then run with

```
docker run --rm -e VAULT_ADDR=localhost:8200 -e VAULT_TOKEN=hsv.yourtoken vault-mcp
```

### Environment Variables

These are required to run the MCP Vault server:

- `VAULT_ADDR`: Your HashiCorp Vault server address
- `VAULT_TOKEN`: A valid Vault token with read/write permissions
- `MCP_PORT`: Optional. Defaults to 3000. Not required for Cursor.

```

#### `secret_read`

Retrieves a secret from specified path.

```ts
await tool("secret_read", {
  path: "apps/myapp/config",
});
```

#### `secret_delete`

Soft-deletes a secret (versioned delete in KV v2).

```ts
await tool("secret_delete", {
  path: "apps/myapp/config",
});
```

---

### Policy Management

#### `policy_create`

Creates a new Vault policy with specified permissions.

```ts
await tool("policy_create", {
  name: "app-readonly",
  policy: `
    path "secret/data/apps/myapp/*" {
      capabilities = ["read", "list"]
    }
  `,
});
```

---

### Resources

#### `generate_policy`

Generates a Vault policy from path and capabilities.

```ts
await prompt("generate_policy", {
