# üßæ Odoo Accounting MCP Server

This is a simplified, non-production-ready Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed for experimental integration with **Odoo Accounting** via XML-RPC. Specifically tailored for use with [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai), this project focuses on enabling AI tools to query and analyze **account journal entries** for audit purposes. While it allows interaction with Odoo accounting data, its current scope is limited to this specific use case and is not intended for production environments. Future exploration might consider expanding to other accounting-related data, such as invoices, depending on the outcomes of the initial focus.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Guide

Follow these steps to set up and run the Odoo Accounting MCP Server:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/odoo-accounting-mcp.git
cd odoo-accounting-mcp
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory and populate it with your Odoo connection details:

```ini
ODOO_URL=http://localhost:8069
ODOO_DB=your_db_name
ODOO_USERNAME=your_odoo_user_name
ODOO_PASSWORD=your_odoo_password
```

### 3. Set Up Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate it:

```bash
.\.venv\Scripts ctivate
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages from the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Run the Server

Start the MCP server using the main Python script:

```bash
python main.py
```

The server will typically start and be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Claude Desktop Integration

You don't need to manually run the MCP server when using Claude Desktop. Instead, configure Claude Desktop to manage the server lifecycle.

Update your `claude_desktop_config.json` file with the following configuration (adjust the paths and Odoo credentials as necessary):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "odoo": {
      "command": "python",
      "cwd": "D:/jeevan-projects/odoomcp/odoo_account_mcp",
      "args": ["main.py"],
      "env": {
        "ODOO_URL": "http://localhost:8069",
        "ODOO_DB": "your_db",
        "ODOO_USERNAME": "admin",
        "ODOO_PASSWORD": "your_password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Important Notes:**

- Ensure the `cwd` path in the configuration points to the correct directory of your `odoo_account_mcp` project.
- Replace the placeholder Odoo credentials with your actual Odoo instance details.
