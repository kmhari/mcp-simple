## üåü Overview

TaskFlow MCP is a specialized server that helps AI assistants break down user requests into manageable tasks and track their completion. It enforces a structured workflow with user approval steps to ensure tasks are properly tracked and users maintain control over the process.

## ‚ú® Features

- üìã **Task Planning**: Break down complex requests into manageable tasks
- üîç **Subtasks**: Divide tasks into smaller, more manageable subtasks
- üìä **Progress Tracking**: Track the status of tasks, subtasks, and requests with visual progress tables
- üëç **User Approval**: Enforce user approval steps to ensure quality and control
- üíæ **Persistence**: Save tasks and requests to disk for persistence across sessions
- üîÑ **Flexible Management**: Add, update, or delete tasks and subtasks as needed
- üìù **Detailed Reporting**: View task details and progress tables
- üì§ **Export Options**: Export task plans and status reports in Markdown, JSON, or HTML formats
- üì¶ **Dependencies**: Track project and task-level dependencies with version information
- üìå **Notes**: Add project-level notes for important information and preferences

## üöÄ Installation

### Global Installation

```bash
npm install -g @pinkpixel/taskflow-mcp
```

### Local Installation

```bash
npm install @pinkpixel/taskflow-mcp
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Starting the Server

If installed globally:

```bash
taskflow-mcp
```

If installed locally:

```bash
npx taskflow-mcp
```

### Configuration

By default, TaskFlow MCP saves tasks to `~/Documents/tasks.json`. You can change this by setting the `TASK_MANAGER_FILE_PATH` environment variable:

```bash
TASK_MANAGER_FILE_PATH=/path/to/tasks.json taskflow-mcp
```

### MCP Configuration

To use TaskFlow MCP with AI assistants, you need to configure your MCP client to use the server. Create an `mcp_config.json` file with the following content:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "taskflow": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@pinkpixel/taskflow-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "TASK_MANAGER_FILE_PATH": "/path/to/tasks.json"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## üîÑ Workflow

TaskFlow MCP enforces a specific workflow:

1. **Plan Tasks**: Break down a user request into tasks (with optional subtasks)
2. **Get Next Task**: Retrieve the next pending task
3. **Complete Subtasks**: If the task has subtasks, complete each subtask before marking the task as done
4. **Mark Task Done**: Mark a task as completed (requires all subtasks to be completed first)
5. **Wait for Approval**: Wait for user approval of the completed task
6. **Repeat**: Continue with the next task until all tasks are complete
7. **Final Approval**: Get user approval for the entire request

For AI assistants to consistently follow this workflow, see the [example-system-prompt.md](./example-system-prompt.md) file for system prompts you can add to your assistant's instructions.

## üß∞ Available Tools
